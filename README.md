# Learning AI
This repository is dedicated to my journey in learning and understanding Artificial Intelligence (AI). It contains various code snippets, experiments, and projects that Iâ€™m working on to explore AI concepts, algorithms, and frameworks.

## neural-network-from-scratch
This part of the Learning AI repository focuses on creating a *modular* neural network from scratch, without relying on deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch.

The model is designed to be as *modular* as possible, allowing parts such as:
- Activation functions
- Batch sizes
- Bias and weight initializers
- Loss functions

to be easily swapped and adjusted.
